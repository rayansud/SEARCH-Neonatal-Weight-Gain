Short guide to Neonatal Weight Analysis Code:

Data is present in nbwt1996_2021.xlsx, with incorrect neonatal sepsis info
Correct neonatal sepsis info is present in birthweight.xlsx
The "merge.do" file merges these and produces a "all_match_data.dta" file
The "cleaning.do" file then cleans the merged data into a "clean_data.dta" file
The "univar.do" file then does univariate analysis, and similarly "bivar.do" does bivariate analysis.
Before running "multivar.do" for multivariate analysis, run "missing.do" to perform multiple imputation for missing data
Then run "multivar.do"

All graphs are saved in the "graphs" folder
Some tables are in the "tables" folder
Some tables are in the "docs" folder
All data is stored in the "data" folder

This code used the following external packages:
estout (ssc install estout)
asdoc (ssc install asdoc)
mivif (ssc install mivif)

Note: the "missing.do" file is extremely computer-intensive, and can take ~30 mins - 1 hour to run on a normal computer
